            <h2><b>Bitwise Industries</b> <small>is the mothership of technological education, collaboration, and innovation in Fresno.</small></h2>
            <p>What happened in the Silicon Valley, Austin, and Portland that didnâ€™t happen in Fresno?
                The founders of Bitwise Industries started asking that question in 2012 and concluded that
                Fresno's tech scene was falling short in three key areas: place, education, and execution.
                Fresno has both the people and potential to become a global tech hub.
